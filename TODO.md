# TODO

## Clean up

- [ ] Change submit button to an image of a tick
- [ ] Switch from pack to grid
- [ ] The code below most of the `isinstance` can be separated into separate functions

## Challenge Features

- [ ] Interface & Accessibility setting — Improve the accessibility of your app by providing an “Accessibility settings” button. This needs to open a new window offering similar functionality to Moodle’s “Interface & Accessibility settings” menu. The user should be able to alter text size, change between light and dark mode, and also define a custom colour scheme (consisting of a background and text colour). Hint: Visit the tkColorChooser module. [4 marks]
- [ ] Permanent Data Storage — Currently, the user needs to create the devices one by one in the shell and the smart home system does not have permanent storage (i.e., upon closing the smart home system, all data will be lost). Investigate the tkFileDialog module of Tkinter which allows the user to upload a file (e.g., a text or a CSV file) where each row represents a device. Your app should also allow the user to save the state of a smart home to a file. [4 marks]
- [ ] Device Scheduler — Add a clock with hour values 0-23 which increment every 3 seconds to simulate the passing of time; “minutes” do not need to be implemented or displayed. Include a scheduling feature for devices using this clock feature, allowing users to set specific times for devices to turn on or off automatically. The main GUI window should show the clock and users should be able to see the devices turn on and off at the set times. [4 marks]
