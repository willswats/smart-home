# TODO

## Features

- [ ] Complete challenge features
- [ ] Pass in `SmartPlug` or `SmartAirFryer` to `add_options_menu_submit` instead of deleting and recreating objects (to create a new instance each time) (this could be why the add window loses focus on submit / goes behind the main window)

## Check

- [ ] If we are allowed to define more classes than the ones in the document
- [ ] If it's okay to things to the classes defined in the document, e.g. `error_message` is added to `SmartPlug`
