## Challenge Features

- [ ] Device Scheduler — Add a clock with hour values 0-23 which increment every 3 seconds to simulate the passing of time; “minutes” do not need to be implemented or displayed. Include a scheduling feature for devices using this clock feature, allowing users to set specific times for devices to turn on or off automatically. The main GUI window should show the clock and users should be able to see the devices turn on and off at the set times. [4 marks]
