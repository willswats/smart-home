# TODO

## Cleanup

- [ ] `self.add_gui_objects` and it's appending is a mess
- [ ] All create_widget methods should return the widgets
- [ ] Don't know if `SmartDevice` should store `string_var` or `gui_objects`, maybe `SmartDeviceSystem` should

## Features

- [ ] Remove submit button for picking on add page, instead just use options menu command
- [ ] Improve error messages (show list of values that are valid)
- [ ] Organize GUI with grid

## Check

- [ ] If we are allowed to add static types
- [ ] If it's okay to add the `error_message` instance variable to `SmartPlug` (not in class diagram)
